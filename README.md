# Project Title

Backend application that allows for the client side application to connect to the database to create users, add profiles and recipes to those users, and retrieve the data if queried with the user ID/recipe ID. The front end part of this application is under construction.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repo down. Then run npm install to install all of the dependencies. Run nodemon in the terminal to get the server up and running.

### Prerequisites

You will need to have node installed on your computer. I have nodemon installed globally on my computer. If you do not wish to do so, you can install nodeman locally to this project as a dependency.

## Deployment

I am using heroku to deploy this site. When you think you're done and ready to push live, push all of your changes up to your remote git master. Either set up heroku to watch over the git repo and deploy automatically, or manually deploy from the heroku CLI/web interface.

## Built With

* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) - The database
* [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) - The object modeling framework used to interface with MongoDB
